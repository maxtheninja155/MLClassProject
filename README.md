# MLClassProject
Class Project for CS Machine Learning A Term 2026 

## Project layout and ownership

Game code lives in `MLClassProject/Assets/_Project/`. One folder per ticket, one assembly per folder, one owner per folder. Work inside your folder; if you need something changed elsewhere, ask its owner.

| Folder | Assembly | May reference | Ticket |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_Project/Core` | `BossFight.Core` | nothing | T1 · Max |
| `_Project/Combat` | `BossFight.Combat` | Core | T2 · Max |
| `_Project/Player` | `BossFight.Player` | Core, Combat | T3 |
| `_Project/Boss` | `BossFight.Boss` | Core, Combat | T4 |
| `_Project/Arena` | `BossFight.Arena` | Core, Combat | T5 |
| `_Project/Agent` | `BossFight.Agent` | Core, Combat, Boss, ML-Agents | T6 · Max |
| `_Project/Input` | `BossFight.Input` | Core, Input System, Cinemachine | T7 · Glove |
| `tools/`, `config/` (repo root) | Python, no assembly | — | T8 · Training tooling |
| `_Project/Telemetry` | `BossFight.Telemetry` | Core | T9 · Episode logging |

- **Combat** is documented in `MLClassProject/Assets/_Project/Combat/README.md`: how to put health, stamina, hurtboxes, hitboxes, and attacks on a body.
- **Core** holds the few things everyone shares: `Intent` + `IIntentSource` (controller → body contract; human input, bot, and ML agent all produce an `Intent`, either body consumes it), `IDamageable`, `DamageInfo`, `AttackData`, `BossMove`, `FightEvents`. Change it by PR and tag the people it affects.
- **Scenes:** `_Project/Arena/Scenes/Arena.unity` is the only shared scene (T5 owns it). Everyone else tests in their own `<Area>/Scenes/<Area>_Sandbox.unity`.
- **Prefabs** belong to their folder's owner. To add something to someone else's prefab, make a prefab variant in your folder or ask.
- Need a package in your assembly (Input System, Cinemachine, Animation Rigging)? Add it to your own `.asmdef` references.
- Tags: `Player`, `Boss`. Layers: `Player`, `Boss`, `PlayerHitbox`, `BossHitbox`. Hitboxes only collide with the opposing body.
- Input: `Assets/InputSystem_Actions.inputactions`, Player map: Move, Look, LightAttack, HeavyAttack, Roll, LockOn, Sprint.

## Branching and pull requests

- `Development` is the integration branch. Branch from it and PR into it. `main` only gets updated from `Development` at milestones.
- One branch per ticket, named `feat/T<n>-<short-name>`, for example `feat/T3-player`.
- Rebase on `Development` often. Open a PR into `Development` when the ticket's "done when" is met. One reviewer, then merge and delete the branch.
- A ticket is unblocked when its blocker is **merged to Development**, not when it is done on a branch.
- Never commit `Library/`, `Logs/`, builds, or `results/`.

## Unity merge tool (one-time, per machine)

If two people do touch the same scene or prefab, Unity's Smart Merge resolves most of it. Register it once:

macOS (adjust the editor version to match `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`):
```
git config --global merge.unityyamlmerge.name "Unity SmartMerge"
git config --global merge.unityyamlmerge.driver "'/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.6.0f1/Unity.app/Contents/Helpers/UnityYAMLMerge' merge -p %O %A %B %A"
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```
git config --global merge.unityyamlmerge.name "Unity SmartMerge"
git config --global merge.unityyamlmerge.driver "'C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.6.0f1\Editor\Data\Tools\UnityYAMLMerge.exe' merge -p %O %A %B %A"
```

## Checking your ML-Agents setup

After `uv sync`, prove Unity can talk to the trainer:

1. Open `MLClassProject/Assets/_Project/Agent/Scenes/Agent_Smoke.unity`.
2. From the repo root run:
   ```
   uv run mlagents-learn config/smoke.yaml --run-id=smoke_test --force
   ```
3. When the terminal says it is listening, press Play in Unity. You should see the trainer report it connected and print step summaries. Stop after a few seconds.

If that works, the full pipeline works on your machine.

## Python setup (ML-Agents training)

Everyone needs the **same** Python and package versions, because the Python trainer has to match the Unity package (`com.unity.ml-agents` 4.1.0). This repo pins both, so nobody installs Python by hand:

- `.python-version` pins **Python 3.10.12** (the only range ML-Agents supports is 3.10.1 - 3.10.12).
- `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` pin the ML-Agents Python packages and every transitive dependency.

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage this. It downloads the pinned Python for you.

### One-time setup per machine

1. Install uv:
   - macOS: `brew install uv` (or `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
   - Windows (PowerShell): `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
2. From the **repo root** (the folder with this README), run:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```
   This downloads Python 3.10.12, creates `.venv/` (git-ignored), and installs exactly what is in `uv.lock`.
3. Check it worked:
   ```
   uv run mlagents-learn --help
   ```

### Training

Run commands through `uv run` so they always use the project's Python. From the repo root:

```
uv run mlagents-learn <path/to/config.yaml> --run-id=<run_name>
```

Then press Play in the Unity Editor. Training output lands in `results/` (git-ignored).

If you prefer an activated shell instead of `uv run`: `source .venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).

### Rules

- Do not `pip install` into the venv by hand. To add or change a dependency, edit `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock`, and commit the updated `uv.lock`.
- After pulling changes that touch `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock`, run `uv sync` again.
- Apple Silicon Macs: every `uv sync` / `uv run` prints `~ grpcio==1.53.2` (a reinstall). This is a harmless quirk of grpcio's macOS wheel being mislabeled as x86_64 internally; ignore it.
- Optional, Windows + NVIDIA GPU: the default install is CPU-only PyTorch, which is fine for this project. See the PyTorch install page if you want CUDA.
